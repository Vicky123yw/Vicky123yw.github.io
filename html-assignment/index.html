            Hello, nice to meet everyone here. My name is Yuwei Yang, and I am happy to be
            called Vicky. I come from northeast of China, and the weather in my hometown is 
            similar as Ottawa; therefore, I felt a sence of familiarity when I arrived in 
            Ottawa. Before joining in IMD program, I studied Industral Design progrom in my 
            country.

        <p2>I am an animal person; hence, I prefer to visit Wildlife Zoo or Marine Museum.
            Moreover, I have two cats and a dog, but they are in China now, with my parents.
            Outside of that, I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as hiking and jogging. But
            if there is a chance, I would like to take a challenge of diving or skydiving in 
            the future. 
        </p2>
