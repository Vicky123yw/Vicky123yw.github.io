        <p>
            Hello, nice to meet everyone here. My name is Yuwei Yang, and I am happy to be
            called Vicky. I come from northeast of China, and the weather in my hometown is 
            similar as Ottawa; therefore, I felt a sence of familiarity when I arrived in 
            Ottawa. Before joining in <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> program, I studied Industral Design program in my home
            country.

            Moreover, I have two cats and a dog, but they are in China now, with my parents.
            Outside of that, I enjoy doing outdoor activities such as hiking and jogging. But
            if there is a chance, I would like to take a challenge of diving or skydiving in
